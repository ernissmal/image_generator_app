## Usage Example

**For a wooden table:**
```
Transform this wooden table image into a professional e-commerce photograph in a traditional English countryside setting with people. Maintain the exact table design, wood grain patterns, dimensions, and leg style. The table should remain the focal point with sharp focus.

The setting should evoke a traditional English country cottage or farmhouse interior with stone walls, exposed wooden beams, and traditional windows with countryside views. Aged hardwood flooring, traditional rugs, and warm, golden natural light should create a cozy atmosphere.

Three individuals in casual country attire, such as cozy sweaters, flannel, and earth-tone clothing, should be gathered for a meal or tea. Their interactions should be natural. To maintain the overall focus on the table, the people should be slightly blurred or out of primary focus. The setting should evoke a comfortable, homey, and authentic countryside living experience. Perhaps scones, teacups, or homemade food should be present on the table.

The decor should include vintage or antique accessories, ceramic pottery, Windsor chairs, or farmhouse seating. Warm earth tones, such as creams, browns, and sage greens, should dominate the color scheme. The overall design should have a warm, familial, and rustic charm, inviting comfort.

Technical specifications: Photorealistic quality, sharp focus on the table, slightly blurred people, natural shadows, e-commerce ready, 1:1 aspect ratio.
