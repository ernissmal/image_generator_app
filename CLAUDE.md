# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Image Generator App** - A modern image generation application. The project is in early stages with a basic structure defined but no implementation code yet.

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js (v16 or higher)
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn
- **Frontend**: Not yet determined
- **Backend**: Not yet determined

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
npm start
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Node.js application layout:

```
image_generator_app/
├── src/              # Application source code (not yet created)
├── public/           # Static assets (not yet created)
├── tests/            # Test files (not yet created)
├── package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts (not yet created)
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## Common Development Commands

Once the project structure is set up, typical commands will be:

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm start` - Run the application
- `npm test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run build` - Build for production (if applicable)
- `npm run lint` - Lint the codebase (when linter is configured)

## Next Steps

This repository needs:

1. **package.json** - Define project dependencies and scripts
2. **Source structure** - Set up src/, public/, and tests/ directories
3. **Framework selection** - Decide on frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.) and backend approach
4. **Build tooling** - Configure build process (webpack, vite, etc.)
5. **Testing framework** - Set up testing (Jest, Vitest, etc.)
6. **Development guidelines** - Once code exists, establish coding standards and patterns

## Additional Notes

- The `.gitignore` is configured to exclude build artifacts, node_modules, environment files, and IDE configurations
- The project is MIT licensed
